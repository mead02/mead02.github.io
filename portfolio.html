                        <p>This guide details how to use brower cookies with the free software YT-DLP to access and download videos that require an user account to view. The guide also introduces two browser extensions needed to extract cookies for two respective browsers. The guide is styled in a modified instruction manual format, arranging all information to fit on one page. A mockup graphic of a command line window is also included for clarity in how to enter the command to use YT-DLP with user cookies for authentication. All graphics were made in Microsoft Word, and the document uses advanced styles to format both headers and code samples.</p>

                        <p>The report goes over how the grocery industry was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is some review of current sources covering the changes as background, but the main focus is on interviews I did with multiple workers in a large-chain grocery store and their experiences. I created some infographics to match the data, and there is also an analysis of the findings and recommendations for future research.</p>

                        <p>This paper goes over how 4chan's /pol/ board went from not being interested in Donald Trump to actively supporting his run for presidency in 2016. The report has many screenshots of posts and external literature reviews of other works covering /pol/ and Donald Trump. The change over public opinion over time is illustrated with screenshots and key quotes, and conclusions and recommendations for future research are also included. The uniqueness of 4chan in our current net landscape is also discussed in relation to how the users' make political decisions.</p>

                        <p>This poster was made to give a quick overview of how to administer a dose of LOVENOX medication. Since the medication is only available as a self-administered injection, many patients will need to learn how to properly use the product. This poster was made fully in Adobe Photoshop, and all photos were taken by myself. Due to limitations in partipants, an orange was used instead of a patient to demonstrate the injection process. The design of the document was chosen to appeal to all ages, as some younger patients may be prescribed LOVENOX.</p>
